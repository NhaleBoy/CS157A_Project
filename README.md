Audio Entertainment Media Database System


### Project Overview
We have created a database interface that can handle creating an account, signing in, uploading audio files, querying audio files, creating playlists of audio files, and the ability to access and play audio files within the interface.


### Instructions for setting up and running the project

- Additionally download the audio files from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G61eNG8tsjhl7idyLH27qcPxnON7QNk2?usp=sharing and put them within the src/main/webapp/upload directory
- Run a MySQL server using XAMPP
- Run Apache Tomcat 10.1 server
- Then run index.jsp located in src/main/webapp
